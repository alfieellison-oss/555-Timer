\# Alfie's CAD Macropad

Hello! This is my submission for hackpad! This was made with the intention to streamline common cad commands in Autodesk software.



\## Features

\- 5 keyboard switches

\- A rotary encoder with button function
 
\- kmk firmware

\## PCB

Here are pictures of my pcb:

\## CAD

Designed using FreeCAD! It was painful. Be glad you have the current guide, I spent 10+ hours figuring out how to do everything correctly (and even like this I still did stupid stuff).

Everything fits together with 4 m3 screws and bolts

\## Firmware



I wrote the firmware using kmk, you can see it inside the repo. 


\## Notes

Making the  pad was my first time using KiCAD, but hopefully wont be the last. I experimented a fair bit with my trace routing before i came up with a layput that i was moderately happy with.
